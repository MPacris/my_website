                Originally a Theatre major (long story), I chose to change my major to Political Science and minor in Speech Communication as a path to pre-law.  My coursework consisted of research projects and presentations.  One of my favorite projects was based on the mediaâ€™s influence on polling numbers and how demographics shaped campaigns.  This is where I believe my passionate curiosity, analytical mindset, and ability to be comfortable while being uncomfortable began to take shape and become strengths I could rely on in the future.

                What started off as a part-time job while pursuing my undergrad, later turned into becoming a full-time position with aspirations to become manager after graduation.  I was drawn in to the idea of being someone who started from the bottom and became a manager and running my own store.  Eventually, I would be the youngest manager in our district at the time and my store would go on to win multiple sales awards. This experience as a manager strenghtened my abilities as a leader, collaborator, and motivator.  I would leave Champs in 2005 with a new mindset and focus on business and organizational behavior management as I pursued a MBA at the University of New Orleans.

                The pursuit of my MBA at the University of New Orleans started off with a true test of character and will.  In August of 2005, I was only one week into classes before having to evacuate to Baton Rouge for Hurricane Katrina.  Little did I know, that whatever I packed into my car was all I would have left.  It took deep faith and a strong support group to stay motivated and driven to keep pursuing my MBA.  I was able to stay the course and was able to enroll for one semester at LSU.  My second semester was back home at UNO with on-line courses.  Many of the professors had to pivot to on-line coursework which was new to them as well as the students.  In December 2007, I graduated with strengthened skills in resourcefulness, autonomous learning, technological savviness, a newfound liking for data analytics, and most importantly resilience.

                While pursuing my MBA, I found myself working for a contractor gutting houses in the Lakeview area of New Orleans.  There was something about being able to take part in the rebuilding process in New Orleans that made me feel a deeper sense of connection and appreciation for the city and culture.  I would eventually go from gutting houses to working with the carpenters learning how to do trim work, then working with the sheet rockers, plumbers, and painters.  My favorite thing to do was sanding, staining, and finishing woodwork like doors, stairs, rails, and cabinets.  Seeing something go from gutted, to reframed, to rebuilt and then the finishing touches was the most rewarding part.  I left the job in the spring of 2008 in pursuit of a professional career.  (New Orleans summers in the heat are brutal). I came out of the experience with a better understanding and appreciation of project management.  This was also where I started to believe in my ability to learn anything.

                In 2008, during the recession, it was tough trying to find meaningful employment in the New Orleans area.  I found myself drawing a line in the sand that if I was unable to find a job in New Orleans by May 1, I would leave the city and head to Houston where many of my friends had settled post Katrina.  On April 28, I was offered I position with Reily Foods Company to start on May 1.  I was hired into the position as Supply Chain Supervisor which would be the back up to the Production Planning Manager and Transportation Manager.  In my first month, the two managers that I was backing up both went on maternity leave.  From there, it was trial by fire.  Learn on the go.  A few months after everything settled out, my day-to-day activities included scheduling transfers of finished goods between warehouses, arranging inbound freight, creating and maintaining carrier scorecards, performing analysis on warehousing and freight costs, and occasionally scheduling production as needed. As supply chain supervisor, I had taken on a role that never existed before and was lucky to have a VP of Operations that allowed me to grow the position and take on more responsibility as my skillset and abilities were proven.  Aside from my day to day, I was able to work on cross functional projects where I was able to sharpen my research and analysis skill set.  At this point, I was in a visible role amongst our plants, distribution centers, freight carriers, accounting department, and IT department.  This was where my professionalism, accountability, collaborative mindset, ethical beliefs, and resourcefulness began to grow as my core competencies and values.

The focus of this role was working closely with Walmart buyers and replenishment managers to ensure that rollbacks, special events, and new item introductions were stocked appropriately.

To maintain a high Supply Chain Reliability score, I was responsible for researching and maintaining correct lead times and managing any freight claims or deductions.  In this position, I was also able to interview and provide insight on hiring my replacement for my previous position and this position when it was time to move on.  I was also responsible for training those replacements.  I always believed that you should always leave a position better than how you received it.  In my case, these positions were created for me so I was able to provide insight into who my replacement would be.  At this point in my career, I had now gained greater visibility in the company with Sales and Marketing and was seen as someone who was comfortable being customer forward facing.  My skills at providing analysis and presenting to others outside of our department and company were developed.

               As the Purchasing Manager retired, a new position was created to combine purchasing and production planning functionality, and I assumed the role of Operations Business Manager (OBM). In this capacity, I oversaw the entire supply chain for mayonnaise, sauces, and coffee brands. This encompassed purchasing, inventory management, contract negotiations for raw materials, production scheduling, inventory maintenance, and the project management for the introduction of new finished goods.  During my tenure as OBM, I negotiated multiple contracts, conducted RFP bids to lower prices and reduce minimum order quantities for raw materials, and collaborated with manufacturing facilities to optimize production cycles and enhance efficiency through equipment upgrades. Additionally, I led coffee private label bids, working with cross-functional teams on feasibility, pricing, project expectations, and timelines.  At times, I accompanied Sales and Finance to represent Operations and Quality in top-to-top presentations at customer headquarters during bid processes.  Upon successful bids, I managed sample approval production runs, reviewed and approved customer graphics, coordinated with packaging suppliers, scheduled production trials, and ensured first production met customer deadlines and expectations. For branded new products, I collaborated with various teams to determine feasibility, costing, and timelines. During development, I adjusted production schedules, sourced trial quantities of new ingredients, and coordinated with packaging suppliers to accommodate production trials. After approval, I led the review and approval of graphics, ordered initial quantities of printed materials, and adjusted schedules to meet project deadlines. Subsequently, I scheduled process improvement trials and maintained constant communication with Sales to align forecasts with production schedules for new products.  As OBM, I also collaborated with IT to invest in reporting and forecasting tools to be able to provide data visualization to Senior Leadership in S&OP meetings.  At this point, I had a good grasp of supply chain management, my analysis and presentation skills had grown exponentially, and I also added negotiation and project management to my repertoire.

                 At the end of 2016, as the Quality department moved out from underneath the Operations department, I was presented with the opportunity to take on a newly created role of Corporate Audit/ Document Manager.  In this role, I applied a versatile project management approach that blended traditional/waterfall, agile/scrum, and six sigma methodologies to lead continuous improvement projects, ensure internal Reily sites were prepared for audits and maintained quality standards, and collaborate with new copackers to meet product launch requirements. Additionally, I effectively managed cross-functional teams during Rainforest Alliance Certification projects, ensuring seamless collaboration across departments.  In this role I conducted food safety and quality audits on co-packers, suppliers, and our own Reily Foods Company sites, ensuring strict compliance with GFSI and FDA standards.  To enhance our document management capabilities, I spearheaded the implementation of a TraceGains program, significantly improving supplier approval processes and monitoring through data-driven dashboards. When faced with supplier and copacker nonconformances, I engaged in collaborative efforts with suppliers, employing robust root cause analysis and corrective action strategies to resolve issues effectively.  I also utilized Power BI reports to meticulously review nonconformance and defect data, working closely with site QA Managers to drive continuous improvement efforts. My collaboration with site QA Managers also extended to creating HACCP/Food Safety Plans, devising international adulteration risk assessments, formulating supply chain vulnerability assessments, and compiling comprehensive continuous improvement reports.  Collaborating with plant QA managers and site internal auditors, I championed the development of a cutting-edge auditing tool within Redzone, skillfully leveraging Tableau to deliver actionable insights and data visualization.
